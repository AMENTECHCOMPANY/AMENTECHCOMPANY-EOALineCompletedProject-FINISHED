# Security Checklist - Secrets Protection

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- [x] Removed all secrets from `.env` file
- [x] Created `.env.example` template with placeholder values
- [x] Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` and related files
- [x] Verified no secrets in build output (`dist/` folder)

### 2. Documentation Updates
- [x] Updated `README.md` to remove example secrets
- [x] Updated `STRIPE_COMPLETE_SETUP.md` with security warnings
- [x] Created `NETLIFY_SETUP.md` with deployment instructions
- [x] Added security best practices to all documentation

### 3. Netlify Configuration
- [x] Updated `netlify.toml` with comments for environment variables
- [x] Created deployment guide for setting up Netlify environment variables
- [x] Added production environment context

### 4. Build Verification
- [x] Successfully built project without secrets in output
- [x] Verified no API keys, tokens, or secrets in `dist/` folder
- [x] Confirmed Vite only includes environment variables with `VITE_` prefix

## üîê Required Actions for Deployment

### Before Deploying to Netlify:

1. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify Dashboard**
   - Go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add all required variables (see `NETLIFY_SETUP.md`)
   - Use appropriate scopes (production vs preview)

2. **Required Variables:**
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_stripe_public_key
   VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Optional Server-side Variables** (if using Netlify Functions):
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_actual_stripe_secret_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_supabase_service_role_key
   ```

### Local Development:

1. **Create your local `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Add your actual credentials to `.env`**
   - This file is ignored by git
   - Never share or commit this file

3. **Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`:**
   ```bash
   grep "^\.env$" .gitignore
   ```

## üö® Security Warnings

### Never Commit These Files:
- `.env`
- `.env.local`
- `.env.production`
- Any file containing real API keys or secrets

### Never Include in Source Code:
- Stripe secret keys (sk_test_, sk_live_)
- Supabase service role keys
- Webhook signing secrets (whsec_)
- Database passwords
- Private keys or certificates

### Client-side vs Server-side:
- ‚úÖ **Safe for client:** `VITE_*` variables (public keys, URLs)
- ‚ùå **Never expose:** Secret keys, service role keys, webhooks secrets

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All secrets removed from `.env` file
- [ ] `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` exists with placeholder values
- [ ] All environment variables set in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Build succeeds without secrets scanning errors
- [ ] Test deployment with preview environment first
- [ ] Verify application works with environment variables
- [ ] Stripe webhooks configured with correct URLs
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Netlify)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if applicable)

## üîç How to Verify Security

### Check for Secrets in Codebase:
```bash
# Search for common secret patterns
rg -i "(sk_test_|sk_live_|whsec_|eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9)" --type-add 'code:*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,md}' -t code
```

### Check Build Output:
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Search for secrets in dist folder
rg -i "(sk_|pk_|whsec_)" dist/
```

### Verify Environment Variables:
```bash
# Check that .env is gitignored
git check-ignore .env

# Should output: .env
```

## üÜò If Secrets Were Exposed

If you accidentally committed secrets to git:

1. **Immediately rotate all exposed keys:**
   - Generate new Stripe API keys
   - Generate new Supabase keys
   - Update all services using old keys

2. **Remove from git history:**
   ```bash
   # Use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
   # See: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository
   ```

3. **Update all deployments with new keys**

4. **Monitor for unauthorized access**

**Remember:** Security is not a one-time task. Regularly review and update your security practices.
